However, where STO is \\noperational, partial withdrawals from the Liquid Fund shall not be permitted. Any partial withdrawal request from the Liquid Fund will result in cessation of STO. iv. Partial withdrawals are not allowed during the Settlement Period or when the RPO is operational as well as not\\nallowed post the death of Life Assured in case Cover Option 2 (Care Option) is chosen. Unlike other cover options, Sum Assured payable on death under Cover Option 2 (Care Option) is not reduced by the partial withdrawals made by the Life Assured prior to his / her death. 3. Systematic  Withdrawal Option (SWO)\\nSWO is a systematic partial withdrawal facility. Under this option, a pre-decided percentage of the fund value\\nwill be withdrawn \\nand paid to the Policyholder at a chosen frequency for the remainder of the Policy Term. The \\nPolicyholder can choose for SWO option at inception or anytime during the Policy Term provided the outstanding Policy Term is at least 5 years. The availability / operation of this option will be subject to the following conditions:\\ni. Premium Payment Term has to be greater than or equal to 10 years. ii. Life Assured should have attained 18 years of age at the time of payout.iii. Policyholder can choose from 1% to 12% of the Fund Value to be withdrawn in a Policy Year.iv. The withdrawals under SWO will start from 11th Policy Year onwards or the Policy Anniversary immediately \\nfollowing the SWO request, whichever is later. v. The withdrawals will be payable in arrears in yearly, half yearly, quarterly or monthly mode as chosen by the \\nPolicyholder where the annual percentage chosen for SWO will be split equally across a Policy Year depending \\nupon the frequency. As an example, if a Policyholder chooses an SWO percentage of 12% for a Policy Year at monthly frequency, then every month, 1% of the Fund Value will be withdrawn and paid to the Policyholder once the SWO has become operational. vi. Resultant Fund Value after any withdrawal should be at least 120% of the Annualized Premium payable in a \\nyear at inception of the Policy. Further, the minimum SWO payout should be at least Rs. 1,000. If any of these conditions are triggered at any of the times at which a withdrawal is due under this feature, the withdrawal will not be aﬀected, no payout will be made and future withdrawals under SWO will be stopped. If the customer wants to re-activate this option, he / she will have to give a fresh request for the same. vii. SWO feature can be re-activated or stopped anytime during the Policy Term provided that for re-activation, the\\noutstanding Policy Term is at least 5 years.'),\n",

While STO is operational, you are not allowed to change your 'Target STO' Fund. Source STO Fund and Target STO Fund would together be referred to as STO Funds. Under this option, during the Premium Payment Term, the Fund Value available in the Liquid Fund at the beginning \\nof each month (net of applicable charges) shall be switched to 'Target STO Fund' by cancelling units in the Liquid Fund and purchasing units in the 'Target STO Fund' till the availability of units in the Liquid Fund, in the following manner:\\nIn case of Single Premium policy, the STO will be operational during the ﬁrst Policy Year. STO shall be subject to the following conditions:\\ni. This option can be availed at Policy Commencement Date or at any Policy Anniversary with prior request, submitted at\\nleast 30 days before the Policy Anniversary. Once STO request is accepted, the STO shall be eﬀective from the Policy \\nAnniversary immediately following the receipt of such request. ii. STO can be opted / re-opted only when Premiums are paid in annual mode and will be operational during the Premium \\nPayment Term only, provided due premium has been paid. STO cannot be opted once all Premiums payable under the Policy have been paid.\")]"

      "1. **Life Cover**: In case of Mr. Kumar's unfortunate death during the policy term, his family will receive a lump sum payment of Rs. 50,00,000 (Sum Assured) or higher of Rs. 6,63,96,009 (Fund Value), whichever is higher.\n",
      "2. **Accumulated Savings**: At the end of 20 years, Mr. Kumar's Fund Value will be approximately Rs. 31,49,22,901 (assuming an annual gross investment return of 8%).\n",
      "3. **Maturity Benefit**: On maturity, Mr. Kumar will receive a lump sum payment of Rs. 31,49,22,901.\n",

      " To illustrate the potential benefits of the Canara HSBC Life Insurance Invest 4G plan, let's consider a hypothetical scenario for a 30-year-old individual (John) who decides to invest in this policy with a term of 35 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Premium Payments: John chooses to pay annual premiums for the entire 35 years. The total amount he pays will depend on the selected premium amount. For simplicity, let's assume that John pays an annual premium of Rs. 1,00,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Loyalty Additions: Over the policy term, John receives loyalty additions at the end of every 5th year (i.e., on the 5th, 10th, 15th, etc., policy anniversaries). Since this is his first investment, he will start receiving these additions from the 5th year onwards. Assuming a Loyalty Addition Percentage of 3% for the selected fund and taking an average fund value of Rs. 10,00,000 over the last 60 monthly policy anniversaries (considering the first 4 years as settling in period), John would receive a Loyalty Addition of Rs. 30,000 at the end of his 5th year.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Wealth Boosters: Assuming there are Wealth Boosters available for John's selected fund, he will also receive these boosters as per the table provided in the plan document. Again assuming that the average fund value is Rs. 10,00,000 and considering a Wealth Booster Percentage of 2%, John would receive an additional boost of Rs. 20,000 at some point during the policy term (exact timing depends on the policy document).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Returns: The returns from this policy will depend on the performance of the selected fund(s) and the capital market conditions over the policy term. For illustration purposes, let's assume that John's fund grows at an average rate of 10% per annum over the entire 35 years. This growth assumes reinvestment of all maturity benefits, loyalty additions, wealth boosters, and the return of mortality charges (RMC) throughout the policy term.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Maturity Benefit: In this scenario, John will turn 100 on his 40th policy anniversary. Given that he has survived till then, the maturity benefit payable would be the fund value as on the date of maturity. Assuming a cumulative growth rate of 10% per annum from age 30 to 100, John's fund value at maturity could potentially grow to around Rs. 6.4 crores (this is an approximate calculation and does not account for other factors such as market volatility or policy charges).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Policy Termination: If John were to pass away before maturity, the death benefit payable would be the higher of the fund value at the time of death or the guaranteed sum assured. In this hypothetical example, since the focus is on the maturity benefit, it's assumed that John survives till age 100 and receives the maturity benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "This illustration provides a simplified view of the potential benefits of the Canara HSBC Life Insurance Invest 4G plan for a 30-year-old investing for 35 years. The actual benefits may vary depending on factors such as premium amount, selected fund(s), policy charges, and market conditions during the policy term.
